CodinGame started organizing community contests in 2017. The first one, Mean Max, was published in November 2017. The full list of community contests can be found [here](pages/community/contest.md)

The last community contest, Ocean of Code, was held on March 2020.

Since then, two large challenges are organized and created by CodinGame every year: one in Spring, and one in Fall.
