# Tech.io Playground <a name="playground"/>

Tech.io is a free knowledge-sharing platform created by CodinGame in 2017 in parallel to its activities.

Anyone can contribute and share their knowledge about something to the community. A playground can be an article, a tutorial, a guide...anything that can help other developers!

The Tech.io technology allows to embed **runnable code snippets** inside a playground.

There is no moderation on Tech.io.

The help to create a Tech.io article can be found in the [Tech.io documentation](https://tech.io/playgrounds/408/tech-io-documentation).
