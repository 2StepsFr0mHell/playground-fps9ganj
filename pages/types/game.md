Coding games are turn-based games; they're most of the times associated with a viewer. They're built with the CodinGame Game Engine (sdk). See the technical details in the [sdk documentation](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation).

In an "infinite" loop, the player(s) must read the entries from the standard input stream and send a response to the Standard Output stream to play the game.

There are three types of coding games.

**All coding games should**
- respect the [statement guidelines](pages/technical/statement.md#guidelines).
- respect the [games general guidelines](#guidelines).
- follow [best practices](#best-practice).

## Solo Puzzle (with a viewer)<a name="gameloop"/>

Like for In/Out puzzles, the player plays against the game and must pass all test cases to solve the puzzle.

_Example: [Power of Thor](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1)
Each turn, the player must output a direction for Thor to take to finally reach the light._

**Solo puzzles should also respect the [test cases guidelines](pages/technical/testcase.md#guidelines).**

## Multiplayer Game (bot programming) <a name="ai"/>

Participants play against themselves in matches of 2 to 4 players in an arena. No more test cases. Once players submit their code (AI) in the arena, the system matches them against other players of the arena. Each match between players impacts their score, hence their ranking.

In each league but the last (Legend), there is a reference bot: the boss. Any player who ends up above the boss' score after their ranking battles are finished will be promoted to the league above.

## Optimization Puzzle <a name="opti"/>

Optimization puzzles are puzzles for which a player's score is computed. All players are then ranked against this score.

# General Guidelines <a name="guidelines"/>

When creating your coding game, we ask you to follow these guidelines in order to improve both its performance and players experience.

- **Graphics**
  - The graphics must be self-explanatory. _A player should understand most of the rules from a replay_
  - The graphics must contain the avatars and nicknames of current players (if bot programming).
- **Referee**
  - The referee must end a player's program when receiving an unrecognizable command.
  - The referee must send an error message in the console when receiving an invalid but recognized command.
  - The referee must stop the game early if the game is stale or already decided.
  - The referee must not crash. All exceptions must be caught (especially during the parsing of a Playerâ€™s actions, where most errors occur).
  - Indices must start at 0, not 1. The origin is always the top left pixel/tile.
