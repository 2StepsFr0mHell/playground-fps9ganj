# Specific Guidelines

## Clash of Code

**CoC puzzles should be solvable in less than 5 minutes.**

_The main goal of a CoC battles is to be short (except in the "Shortest" mode). CoC players don't expect to learn something from solving a CoC puzzle; they'll choose practice puzzles for that._

**Close duplicates are allowed.**

_If the puzzles' themes differ, it's ok to accept multiple versions of the same programming problem_

**No puzzle is too easy.**

_No CoC puzzle should be rejected because it's too simple._


## Optimization Puzzles

**It must be very difficult to approach the optimal score.**

## Multiplayer Games

**It's possible to write a working AI in a few minutes.**

**If several leagues exist: boss difficulty is low but requires knowledge of each new set of rules per league.**
