Feel free to contact any moderator should you have an issue with another community member.

**Moderators are volunteers who enjoy CodinGame and its community. While they'll usually be happy to help you with a programming question, they don't have to answer you, so don't ping them for that. Prefer an open question or check the forum.**

Community moderators have moderation powers on CG chat, Discord and the forum. 

Most CodinGame staff members have moderation rights too. Their username starts with "[CG]".

## Chat Moderation Guidelines (for moderators)

- **Engage in Good Faith**: don't assume the worst from users and try to understand first the reason for an abusive behavior
- **Lead by Example**: show everyone what's expected from them - great attitude and kindliness
- **Trust the Team**: in doubt, ask other moderators or staff members for their opinion on the matter
- **Warning, Kick, Ban**: notify the abuser with a _public_ warning first, then kick if necessary, then ban if necessary

Moderators have the trust of CodinGame's staff but we reserve ourselves the rights to revoke a moderator rights should any abuse occur.
