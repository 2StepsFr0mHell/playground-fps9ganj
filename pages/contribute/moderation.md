## Moderation Rights

Anyone can vote (upvote/downvote) any contribution.

There are two different moderation rights:

- **Approver right**: approvers can approve or reject contributions. They also can edit contributions under review (not yet approved/rejected).
- **Editor right**: editors have approver rights. Editors can also edit approved contributions.
