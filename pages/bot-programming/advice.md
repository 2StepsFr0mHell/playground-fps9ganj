## Top Tips

1. Read all StdIn
_Not reading all input (as provided in the default code) will most likely break your code. Even if you don't use the input, read it._
2. Send one output per turn
_Unless specified, sending multiple lines of outputs per turn will desynchronize your bot behavior from the game state as you read it in StdIn._
3. Keep it simple
_Some clever but difficult to implement ideas can be counter-productive. You'll spend time implementing them without being sure of the return on investment. Focus on the simplest ideas with the most probable effects._
4. Be pragmatic
_Don't worry about the performance of your code until you reach the Gold league. And even then, if you don't simulate possible moves, you probably don't need to worry._
5. Choose the right battles
_Don't modify your code to counter specific strategies unless a lot of other bots used them. If you beat the boss 80% of the time but lose 80% of the time versus all other bots, you'll never get promoted._

## Leagues

Unfortunately, there is for now no way to reset your progression in a bot programming game. Once you're promoted to a higher league, our system will start matching it with other bots in this new league to rank it correctly.
