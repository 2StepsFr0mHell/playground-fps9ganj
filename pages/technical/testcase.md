A test case is composed of 2 tests:

- a test for the IDE
- a test for validating a solution, often call _validator_.

IDE tests are visible to the participants whereas validators are hidden.

## Guidelines

- the first test case must be a basic one (since it's included in the statement)
- a test and its related validator must differ.
- a test and its related validator must test the same case.
- test cases should cover all specifications
- each test case must have an explicit name
- it's better to include 1 or 2 test cases testing big numbers (except for Clash of Code)

_The more tests, the better._
