A test case is composed of 2 tests:

- a test for the IDE
- a test for validating a solution, often called _validator_.

IDE tests are visible to the players whereas validators are hidden.

## Guidelines <a name="guidelines"/>

- Test cases should cover all specifications
- Test cases must have explicit names
- Each validator must differ from the correspond test
- Each validator should check the same case as the corresponding test
- The first test case must be a simple one (it's included in the statement)

_The more tests, the better._
