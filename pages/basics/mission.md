New to CodinGame? Welcome!

Everything seems a bit complex and overwhelming? Worry no more, and read on!

## Our mission

**Our goal is to empower developers, no matter their educational or professional background, to learn from their peers, level up their skills and showcase their talent.**

_Disclaimer: Except for the content created by the community in the **Learn** section, CodinGame doesn't provide any tutorial to learn the basics of programming from scratch. We highly recommend taking a tutorial online to learn these basics before heading to the **Practice** section and trying to solve coding puzzles._

On CodinGame, you'll be able to:

- practice your programming skills and learn new ones
- find a job and practice programming interviews
- code for fun and chill
- hang out with other passionate coders
- strengthen your confidence and motivation to code
