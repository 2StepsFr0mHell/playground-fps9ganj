The CodinGame platform has many facets but its community definitely represents its beating heart. 

There are several places for CodinGamers to discuss:

- Integrated chat
- Discord Server
- Forum

There are also discussions in the contributions part of CodinGame.

## Integrated chat

There is a chat client integrated on the CodinGame platform. However, you can still connect to the CodinGame chat using an external XMPP client such as [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) or [Gajim](https://gajim.org/)

You should connect to the XMPP server using the following credentials:

*Login*
<your_user_id>@chat.codingame.com

You can find your user id by opening the dev tools on your browser and checking the console (while being on CodinGame). Search for a log saying "Log on pushmessage server as <your_user_id>"

*Password*
Your CodinGame password

*MUC Server*
conference.codingame.com

By specifying “?disableChat=true” to the end of the URL when you’re in the IDE, you’ll disable the chat. It’s useful to gain a bit more space to code, especially when you’re streaming and showing your code on screen.
