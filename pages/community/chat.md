There is a chat client integrated on the CodinGame platform. However, you can still connect to the CodinGame chat using an external XMPP client such as [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) or [Gajim](https://gajim.org/)

You should connect to the XMPP server using the following credentials:

*Login*
<your_user_id>@chat.codingame.com

You can find your user id by opening the dev tools on your browser and checking the console (while being on CodinGame). Search for a log saying "Log on pushmessage server as ..."

*Password*
Your CodinGame password

*MUC Server*
