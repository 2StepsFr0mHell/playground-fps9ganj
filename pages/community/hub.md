# What is a CodingHub?

A CodingHub is an event where developers meet, code and converse.
_Just like a regular day at work!_ üòù

It is organized by one or two hosts. Most of the time, they are regular players in the community. A CodingHub can take place either in a company meeting room, a university classroom, a coworking space or even a living room. Depending on the place, a CodingHub attracts anywhere from 5 to 30 developers. Usually, they are held during work week evenings.

# How to host a CodingHub?

Just fill [this typeform](). Thibaud will check the info as he receives it and will add the link to your event (either Meetup or Facebook) below.

## Why Meetup or Facebook?

An event page helps other CodinGamers to discover the hub and register to the event. It also helps us to know how many goodies we can send.

_Pack of goodies will be sent to CodingHubs with at least 10 people registered to the hub 10 days before the start of the contest._
