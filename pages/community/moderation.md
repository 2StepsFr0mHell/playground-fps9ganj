Any contribution that doesn't respect one or more guidelines from the [contribution guidelines](/pages/contribute/guidelines.md) can be rejected.

## Moderation Process

Anyone can vote (upvote/downvote) any contribution.

A contribution has 3 different states:

- **Private**: a draft that can be shared with friends with the link.
- **WIP**: as Work In Progress. Visible by everyone for feedback and suggestions but not yet ready to be published. WIP cannot be moderated.
- **Ready**: visible by everyone and ready for moderation.

A contribution needs 3 votes from moderators for approval/rejection to get approved/rejected.

Once approved, a contribution gets published as a puzzle/game on the platform. The contribution is still accessible in the list of accepted contributions.
Once rejected, a contribution is sent back to the list of contributions of the creator as rejected. The creator can improve the contribution and resubmit it for moderation of the community.

## Moderation Rights
  
There are two different moderation rights:

- **Approver right**: approvers can approve or reject contributions. They also can edit contributions under review (not yet approved/rejected).
- **Editor right**: editors have approver rights. Editors can also edit approved contributions.

- Any player who has played more than **50** clashes has approver rights.
- Any player who has played more than **300** clashes has editor rights.

For all other contribution types:

- Any player whose level is greater or equals to **20** has approver rights.
- Any player whose level is greater or equals to **29** has editor rights.

## Moderation Bot

The moderation process is not perfect. Hence, a bot will automatically remove "bad" contributions according to community's feedback.

Any Clash of Code puzzle having a bad rating in one of the feedback categories will be rejected.

Rating is computed by mode; this means that modes of the CoC will be progressively removed until there is none, and the CoC contribution is finally rejected.

Any puzzle/game having a bad general rating will be rejected.

The ratings are taken into account once they are enough votes.
